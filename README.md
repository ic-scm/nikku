Web-based BRSTM player

Just open index.html in modern browser, select .brstm file, and enjoy!

`.brstm` file is not included in the repository

The BRSTM decoder is very much adapted from the codes of [BrawlLib](https://github.com/libertyernie/brawltools).

TODO

- [ ] Figure out looping
- [x] Simple UI (play, pause, loop)
